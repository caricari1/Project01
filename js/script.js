//Put event listener on start button so that when you click on button, you are taken to the game screen

//Clicking on the start button should also trigger the program to randomly select a letter

//Based on the letter that is randomly selected, the program should randomly select one of the three photos in the image database that correspond to that letter.

//The program should also randomly place that photo in one of the three card positions

//The other two card positions should be filled by random selection of photos that do not correspond to the letter

//When the player clicks on the correct photo, a star should appear on the right and they should hear a positive-sounding beep

//After the star and posiive sound, the player should be presented with a new letter and a new set of cards

//When the player clicks on the wrong photo, they should hear a negative-sounding beep and the photo should disappear.

//If the player clicks on the wrong photo again, the same thing should happen so that they are left with the right answer. After that, they should be presented with a new letter and a new set of cards

//The game should continue until the player has collected 5 stars
