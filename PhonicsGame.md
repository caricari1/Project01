Phonics Game
============
Designed to help children learn to read, this game presents players with a letter and a set of cards (3 or 5) with images of people, places, and things. The word for one of the images will match the letter. When the player clicks on that image, they get a star and are presented with another set of images. This cycle repeats 5 times, with the player's stars collecting on the screen. When the game has finished, the player is asked if they want to play again. If they answer yes, they are presented with a different set of cards.
